# Virtual-Art-Gallery
Developing a scene of a seemingly endless art gallery in VR.
The problem statement is to develop a virtual art gallery scene in VR. The art gallery
consists of a seemingly endless corridor with paintings on both sides of it. The user is
expected to enter the gallery and walk through it endlessly. Thus, a 3D scene is expected
to be created using some repetitive pattern to give a sense of an endless scene.

## Highlights
- The approach is to first create a static art gallery VR scene to get a better visualization of the scene. 
- The task is to make the scene dynamic, i.e depending on the visitorâ€™s position and movement in VR environment, the gallery should also change its orientation so that the gallery seems endless to the visitor.
- Assuming the visitor only moves in forward direction with respect to gallery, the gallery should be reconstructed repeatedly in such a way that the part already traversed by the visitor disappears.

##  To run the scene
- Initially, the visitor will have to adjust itself to face the gallery.
- Cursor movement will be handled using wasd keys and arrow keys.

## Functionality
- Initially the points are generated using NewPoint API.
- Next, we have generated the points to left and right of the original points at equal distance using Co-ordinate Geometry.
- Then the walls are built dynamically considering the points generated above.
- Visitor can traverse through the corridor infinitely.
